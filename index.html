      <h5>How to use this map</h5>
      <p>
        I have written an <a href="https://lincolnmullen.com/blog/mapping-the-spread-of-american-slavery/">introduction to this visualization</a>. Zoom to any county by clicking on it. Clicking
        on the same county will zoom out. The scales preserve intensity for change
        over time: in other words, a color represents the same thing for each year
        on the map. However, the color scales do not necessarily preserve intensity
        from data field to data field: the darkest color for the total population
        does not represent the same values as for the enslaved population. The
        scales for population are logarithmic (with intermediate values) so every
        second step in the color ramp represents a ten-fold (not a two-fold)
        increase.

      <h5>Explanation of Census data</h5>
      <p>
        The U.S. Census data and shapefiles for these maps comes from Minnesota
        Population Center, <a href="https://www.nhgis.org/"><em>National
            Historical Geographic Information System</em></a>, version 2.0
        (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota,
        2011). For a description of the questions asked on the 1790 to 1860
        censuses, see <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/hiscendata.html"><em>Measuring
            America: The Decennial Censuses From 1790 to 2000</em></a> (U.S Census
        Bureau, 2002). Bear in mind the reason the Census kept statistics on
        slavery. Slaves were counted
        in the Census because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise">three-fifths</a>
        compromise in the federal constitution, by which an enslaved person
        counted as three-fifths of a person when apportioning representation in
        Congress and direct taxes. I have tried to represent unavailable data on
        the map, but sometimes in the Census a value of zero actually means that
        the data has been lost or was never gathered. Treat the Census numbers
        skeptically: even in the best of circumstances the Census undercounts the
        population. For example, Harvey Amani Whitfield has shown that <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/research/?Page=news&storyID=17688&category=uvmresearch">
          Vermont did have slavery</a>, even though no slaves were enumerated in
        the Census. The numbers are useful chiefly for showing degrees of
        magnitude. Below are the fields in the NHGIS data that I have used. The
        total free population was always calculated by subtracting the slave
        population from the total population.
